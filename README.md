# Web-Design-Challenge - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

For this homework created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment (WeatherPy in the Python-API-Challenge). Individual pages for each plot have been created along with a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build the vizualizations.

The dashboard can be viewed at: https://neha-nayeem.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge

## Notes

This folder contains:

* A `resources` folder that contains the `cities.csv` file.

* An `images` folder that contains the four visualization plots from the analysis.

* Seven HTML files that constitute the entire dashboard content.

* A `styles.css` file that contains additional styling to the website, including image centering, navbar background color, media queries, color changes on hover, etc.

* A Jupyter notebook called `data-to-html.ipynb` that was used to read the CSV file into a dataframe and convert that into an HTML table to use in the website.
